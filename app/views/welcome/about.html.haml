  %h1 About the Site

%p
  This is a live version of a test client for the
  %a{:href => "http://www.fitbit.com"} Fitbit service.
  It uses the
  %a{:href =>"http://rubygems.org/gems/fitgem"} fitgem
  to connect to the Fitbit OAuth API for data access, and contains a variety of examples focused on how
  to access the different types of data exposed by Fitbit.

%p If you have a Fitbit account, you can walkthrough the server-side steps on how to authenticate a user with Fitbit and then get data.  It also currently includes a test interface to experiment with how data subscriptions work since the documentation on the process is a little light on the Fitbit developer site.
