<h3>About This Site</h3>
<p>This is a running version of a test client for the <a href="http://www.fitbit.com">Fitbit service</a>.  It's written in Ruby 1.9 on top of Rails 3, and uses <a href="http://rubygems.org/gems/fitgem">fitgem</a> to connect to the Fitbit OAuth API for data access.</p>
<p>If you have a Fitbit account, you can walkthrough the server-side steps on how
	to authenticate a user with Fitbit and then get data.  It also currently includes a test interface to experiment with how data subscriptions work since the documentation on the process is a little light on the Fitbit developer site.</p>
